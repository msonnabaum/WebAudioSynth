**Evented JavaScript for the browser**

This script adds the EventEmitter class to your browser.

So you can listen for and emit events from what ever objects you choose.

EventEmitter deters from the NodeJS implementation slightly but it is lighter and faster.

## Example

	// Initialise the EventEmitter
	var ee = new EventEmitter();
	
	// Initialise the listener function
	function myListener() {
		console.log('The foo event was emitted.');
	}
	
	// Add the listener
	ee.addListener('foo', myListener);
	
	// Emit the foo event
	ee.emit('foo'); // The listener function is now called
	
	// Remove the listener
	ee.removeListener('foo', myListener);
	
	// Log the array of listeners to show that it has been removed
	console.log(ee.listeners('foo'));

## API

This is just the method list for the API. For in-depth argument documentation please check the source. Every method has a JSDoc comment block that explains every aspect of the method.

 * EventEmitter.Event(type, listener, scope, once) - Event class, used internally for listener managing.
   * EventEmitter.Event.fire(args) - Calls the events listener with the specified array of arguments.
 * EventEmitter.eachListener(type, callback) - Loops over every listener for an event passing them to the callback.
 * EventEmitter.addListener(type, listener, scope, once) - Adds an event listener for the specified event.
 * EventEmitter.on(type, listener, scope, once) - Alias of the addListener method.
 * EventEmitter.once(type, listener, scope) - Alias of the addListener method but will remove the event after the first use.
 * EventEmitter.removeListener(type, listener) - Removes the a listener for the specified event.
 * EventEmitter.removeAllListeners(type) - Removes all listeners for a specified event.
 * EventEmitter.listeners(type) - Retrieves the array of listeners for a specified event.
 * EventEmitter.emit(type, args) - Emits an event executing all appropriate listeners.

## Tests

EventEmitter is tested and working in the following browsers.

 * Chrome
 * Firefox
 * Safari

If you test it in something a little more obscure, please let me know how it turned out.

To test, simply run `test.html` in the test folder.
